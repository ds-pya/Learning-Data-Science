/**
 * Computes genre-wise scores based on music listening behavior over a specified time range.
 *
 * The function filters the input data based on the optional target platforms, genres, and actions,
 * and computes per-genre scores by:
 * 1. Splitting the target time range into 1-hour buckets.
 * 2. Calculating per-bucket scores using time decay (exponential), overlap duration, and weight.
 * 3. Aggregating platform-level scores for each genre using softmax-scaled platform weights.
 *
 * If `endTime` is null, the current system time is used.
 * If a filter list (e.g., `targetPlatforms`) is null, no filtering is applied for that field.
 *
 * @param data The list of music listening records.
 * @param startTime The start of the time range in epoch milliseconds.
 * @param endTime The (optional) end of the time range in epoch milliseconds.
 * @param targetPlatforms Optional list of platforms to include.
 * @param targetGenres Optional list of genres to include.
 * @param targetActions Optional list of actions to include.
 * @return A map of genre to its final computed score (normalized across platforms).
